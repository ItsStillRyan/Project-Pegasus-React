## A MERN stack with mongoDB project for Assignment 2
***

## **Context**
___
### _Opening Statement & Summary_
This assignment has required us, the programmers, to create an interactive website using a MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. Demonstrating my proficiency with the technologies.

This project that I've created, within the set requirements, is essentially a a website forum for Astrophotographers, to share what they have found, get involved in discussions with each other and share their personal knowledge on things they have learned during the process.

In talking about Space and its current age of technological advancements, its most recent success with Perseverance, the rover on Mars, and along with that, the constant successes with spaceX’s falcon 9 flights.

As more of these are coming on to the front page of social media, the general topic and interest has been gaining a lot of traction. One of the avenues is Astrophotography. Capturing images of space bodies millions of lightyears away from where we are standing. I wanted to create a portal that holds this avenue and give a collaboration space for amateurs and veteran astrophotographers alike. So this is what the basis of my project is about.

___
### _Personal goals and expected user goals_
What I, as the programmer, hope to achieve is to provide a focused portal for like-minded individuals to share and discuss topics around this hobby.

As the user, the goal is to have a place where I can share my findings, pictures and methods to other like-minded people in this hobby.

## UI and Design Choices
___
#### **Space/futuristic themed. Around a main focus**
As this website revolves around the topic of space, I'm going for a futuristic sci-fi look. Using a constellation map in the background, it cuts through the mundane solid color. 

#### **Color choices and Fonts**
 Using darker complementary colors like dark blue and its other shades. Contrasting it with yellow and turquiose in only my main logo just to make it stand out from the dark.

## Technologies Used
___
As with the requirements of this project, it is done within the limits of **MongoDB, Express, React, Node**.
All coding has been done in **Gitpod** IDE, including a seperate repository as a testing workbench.

**I also employed the use of external frameworks such as:**

#### **REACT Bootstrap in 2 kinds** https://react-bootstrap.github.io/ & https://mdbootstrap.com/

#### **Axios** https://github.com/axios/axios

**Tools involved during development:**

#### **Drawio** https://app.diagrams.net/
Using Drawio for my Site map

## Future development plans and Existing Bugs
___
1. Mainly looking into UI changes. Loading screen in particular could add more immersion.

2. Filtering. I am aware of the lack of filtering in this project so this would be one of the top priority in the list to tackle and implement.

3. A better use of REACT.JS without doing a windows.reload for certain pages. 
***
## Deployment
___
### Content
* Ensure all last changes are saved and committed
* Successfully went through with a Git Push
___
### Express.js deployment to Heroku
1. After confirming and pushing the final build of the project, run the command to download Heroku

        npm install -g heroku
2. After install has succeded, log in to heroku with

        heroku login -i
    Enter username and password
3. Create Heroku app

        heroku create <app-name>
    Replace <app-name> with a name of your choice. Do not use underscore. As the app name has to be unique, make sure the name you use is distinctive. You can use your initials as part of the app name, for instance.
4. The Procfile executes a command when Heroku needs to run our server. Create one in the same directory as index.js and **name it as Procfile (the first alphabet must be capitalized, and there is no extension).**

5. Add the following line to the Procfile:

        web: node index.js

6. Add a start script to package.json

        {
        "name": "06-api-auth",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "",
        "main": "index.js",
        "scripts": {
            "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
            "start": "node index.js"
        },
        . . .
        }
7. Change the port that we are using

    Change the 3000 in app.listen to process.env.PORT
8. Push to Heroku
    Make sure you have a .gitignore file, and it must have node_modules, sessions/ and .env included,

        git push heroku master

9. We need to duplicate the content of the .env file inside the config variables section of Heroku.

    Go to Heroku and look for the app you just deployed. Then click on Settings.

    Next, click on Reveal Config Vars

    After which, add in MONGO_URL, and the connection URL from your .env file:

10. Run the app

    From your Heroku project panel, click on the button that says Open App. Test if your app is working.



___
### React.js deployment to Netlify
1. After confirming and pushing the final build of the project, run the command 

        npm run build
2. A build folder should be created in the explorer. Download the file and unzip  build.tar
3. Log into Netlify.com and go to the Sites tab
4. Drag the build folder into the box that says "Drag and drop your site output folder here"
5. Wait for the project to be deployed.
