## A MERN stack with mongoDB project for Assignment 2
***

## **Context**
___
### _Opening Statement & Summary_
This assignment has required us, the programmers, to create an interactive website using a MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. Demonstrating my proficiency with the technologies.

This project that I've created, within the set requirements, is essentially a a website forum for Astrophotographers, to share what they have found, get involved in discussions with each other and share their personal knowledge on things they have learned during the process.

In talking about Space and its current age of technological advancements, its most recent success with Perseverance, the rover on Mars, and along with that, the constant successes with spaceXâ€™s falcon 9 flights.

As more of these are coming on to the front page of social media, the general topic and interest has been gaining a lot of traction. One of the avenues is Astrophotography. Capturing images of space bodies millions of lightyears away from where we are standing. I wanted to create a portal that holds this avenue and give a collaboration space for amateurs and veteran astrophotographers alike. So this is what the basis of my project is about.

___
### _Personal goals and expected user goals_
What I, as the programmer, hope to achieve is to provide a focused portal for like-minded individuals to share and discuss topics around this hobby.

As the user, the goal is to have a place where I can share my findings, pictures and methods to other like-minded people in this hobby.
